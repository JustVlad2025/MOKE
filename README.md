# MOKE

Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect

Just share my modest success. Better find another expert in it

# MOKE Lab Tool

**MOKE Lab Tool** is a Python-based program for performing and analyzing **Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE)** measurements.  
It is designed to help researchers acquire data, process magneto-optical signals, and visualize hysteresis loops with minimal setup effort.

## ðŸ§² What is MOKE?
The **Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect** occurs when the polarization of reflected light changes in the presence of a magnetic field.  
It is widely used to study thin films, nanostructures, and magnetic materials.  

This program simplifies experimental data collection and provides real-time analysis of Kerr rotation signals.
